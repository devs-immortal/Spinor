# Spinor

Spinor aims to be a Redstone mod adding utility blocks for converting groups of blocks into moving entities while retaining their functionality. Ie furnaces will continue to smelt, and hoppers will contunue to distrubute items. All while moving. 

Spinor is still very WIP and is mostly a POC.
